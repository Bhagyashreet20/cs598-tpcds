For all items whose price was changed on February 27, 2002, compute the percentage change in inventory between the 30-day period BEFORE the price change and the 30-day period AFTER the change. Group this information by warehouse, and only consider items with current prices between $0.99 and $1.49. The result is limited to the top 100 records, and it is sorted by warehouse name and item ID.
