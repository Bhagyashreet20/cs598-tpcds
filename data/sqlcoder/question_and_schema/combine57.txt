Retrieve the item brands and categories, along with their monthly sales figures for various call centers, specifically for the year 1999. The query focuses on identifying cases where the monthly sales deviated by more than 10% from the average monthly sales for the given year. The results are sorted by the deviation from the average sales and then by call center. Additionally, the sales deviation from both the preceding and following months is included in the report. The limit is set to display the top 100 results that meet these criteria.
