Input: For each state, we have analyzed the items that were sold in stores during the first quarter of 2001, returned in the subsequent three quarters, and then re-purchased by customers through the catalog channel in the following three quarters. We aggregated this data by item ID, item description, and state. Additionally, we calculated various statistics for store sales, store returns, and catalog sales quantities, including counts, averages, and standard deviations. The results are ordered by item ID, item description, and state, and we have limited the output to the top 100 records.
