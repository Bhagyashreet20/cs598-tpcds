This query performs two iterations. In the first iteration, it calculates the coefficient of variation and mean for each item and warehouse pair over two consecutive months in the year 1998. In the second iteration, it selects items that had a coefficient of variation greater than 1.5 in the first month of 1998. The results are ordered by warehouse, item, month, mean, and coefficient of variation in both iterations.
