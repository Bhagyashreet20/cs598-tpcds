With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: Certainly, let's include the years in the description:

First, we identify frequently sold items that were purchased more than four times on any day during four consecutive years (from 2000 to 2003) through the store sales channel.

Next, we calculate the maximum store sales made by any customer over a four-year period (from 2000 to 2003).

We then determine the best store customers who fall in the 5th percentile of sales.

Finally, we compute the total sales from both web and catalog sales channels in a specific month in the year 2000, made by our best store customers who are purchasing our most frequently sold store items.

This final result is limited to 100 records.
