To generate the ratios of weekly web and catalog sales increases from one year to the next year for each week, we calculated the increase in sales for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) between two consecutive years. The sales data was extracted from web and catalog sales records, and the ratios were computed for each day. The resulting report provides insights into how sales patterns change from one year to the next year, broken down by day of the week. The report is ordered by the week sequence.
