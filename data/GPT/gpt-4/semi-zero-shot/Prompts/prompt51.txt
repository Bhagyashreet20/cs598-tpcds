With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: Generate a cumulative sum of sales prices for both web and store sales, calculate the maximum cumulative sales for each item and date, and then compare the maximum cumulative sales for web and store sales. This comparison is done for specific categories and a particular time range. Finally, the results are ordered by item and date, with a limit of 100 records.

The SQL query retrieves data from the 'web_sales' and 'store_sales' tables, calculates cumulative sales over time, and joins the results to compare cumulative sales for specific items and dates. The comparison is based on the 'web_cumulative' and 'store_cumulative' values, and it filters the results to only show records where 'web_cumulative' is greater than 'store_cumulative.' The output is ordered by 'item_sk' and 'd_date' and limited to the top 100 records.
