We then further refine this by looking at various price ranges for sales. Additionally, we break down the analysis based on different combinations of states and sales profit. The query aggregates the store sales data from the year 1999, considering customers with marital status 'U' and education status 'Primary' who made purchases with sales prices between $100.00 and $150.00, customers with marital status 'W' and education status 'College' with sales prices between $50.00 and $100.00, and customers with marital status 'D' and education status '2 yr Degree' with sales prices between $150.00 and $200.00. This information is combined with customer demographics and address details, specifically for customers located in the United States, residing in states such as 'MD', 'MN', 'IA' with net profits ranging from 0 to 2000, and customers in states 'VA', 'IL', 'TX' with net profits between 150 and 3000, as well as customers in states 'MI', 'WI', 'IN' with net profits between 50 and 25000. The result of this comprehensive analysis is the total sales for these various customer segments, sales price ranges, and state-profit combinations."
