This comparison is done for specific categories and a particular time range. Finally, the results are ordered by item and date, with a limit of 100 records.\n\nThe SQL query retrieves data from the 'web_sales' and 'store_sales' tables, calculates cumulative sales over time, and joins the results to compare cumulative sales for specific items and dates. The comparison is based on the 'web_cumulative' and 'store_cumulative' values, and it filters the results to only show records where 'web_cumulative' is greater than 'store_cumulative.' The output is ordered by 'item_sk' and 'd_date' and limited to the top 100 records."
