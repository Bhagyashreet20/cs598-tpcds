In this SQL query, we are performing an analysis to compute the per-customer coupon amount and net profit for a specific group of shoppers. The focus of this analysis is on customers who made purchases on Mondays. To narrow down our criteria, we are only considering purchases made in large stores and over a span of three consecutive years.

Specifically, we are filtering the data to include transactions that occurred on Mondays, as indicated by the condition "date_dim.d_dow = 1" (where Monday is typically represented as 1). Additionally, we are limiting our analysis to purchases made in stores with a certain size, specifically those with a number of employees between 200 and 295.

To further refine our selection, we are considering customers with specific demographics. These customers must have a dependent count of 5 or more (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 5 or more) and own more than 4 vehicles (household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 4).

The query then calculates the total coupon amount ("amt") and net profit ("profit") for each transaction and groups the results by the "ss_ticket_number" and "ss_customer_sk" columns, as well as the store's city ("s_city"). This grouping allows us to aggregate the data for each customer, taking into account their multiple purchases.

Finally, the results of this analysis are sorted in ascending order by customer last name ("c_last_name"), first name ("c_first_name"), the first 30 characters of the store's city name ("substr(s_city,1,30)"), and the net profit ("profit"). Additionally, to manage the volume of results, we have set a limit of 100 rows in the output.

In summary, this SQL query is focused on identifying and analyzing the purchasing behavior of customers who meet specific criteria, including their shopping day, the size of the store, and their demographic information. The results are then organized and presented in a specific order, with a maximum of 100 rows included in the output.
