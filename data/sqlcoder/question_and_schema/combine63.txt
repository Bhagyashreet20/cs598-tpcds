To accomplish the task of calculating the monthly sales of items within specific categories, classes, and brands sold in stores for a given year, and to group the results by store manager, the SQL query first selects the necessary data. It sums the sales prices of items and calculates the average monthly sales for each store manager. It partitions the data by manager and month. The query considers only months within the range of a specific year.

The specific categories, classes, and brands of items to be included in the calculation are filtered as follows:

Categories: Books, Children, Electronics for one set of conditions, and Women, Music, Men for the other set.
Classes: personal, portable, reference, self-help for the first set, and accessories, classical, fragrances, pants for the second set.
Brands: scholaramalgamalg #14, scholaramalgamalg #7, exportiunivamalg #9, scholaramalgamalg #9 for the first set, and amalgimporto #1, edu packscholar #1, exportiimporto #1, importoamalg #1 for the second set.
The query then groups the data by store manager and month of the year (d_moy) and calculates the sum of sales (sum_sales) and the average monthly sales (avg_monthly_sales). It uses a case statement to filter out results where the average monthly sales are greater than 0, and the relative difference between sum_sales and avg_monthly_sales is greater than 10%.

Finally, the results are ordered by store manager (i_manager_id), average monthly sales (avg_monthly_sales), and sum of sales (sum_sales), and the query limits the output to the top 100 results.
