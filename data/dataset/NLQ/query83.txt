Retrieve the items with the highest number of returns where the number of returns was approximately equivalent across all store, catalog, and web channels (within a tolerance of +/- 10%), within the week ending on '2001-06-06', '2001-09-02', or '2001-11-11'. The query calculates the return quantities for each channel (store, catalog, and web) for the specified dates and aggregates them for each item. It then computes the deviation percentage for each channel's return quantity from the total return quantity, and selects the top 100 items based on their item IDs and store return quantities, ordered by item ID and store return quantity.
