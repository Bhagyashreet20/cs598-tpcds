Input: This query provides data on the worst return ratios (sales to returns) for all items in each channel, considering the quantity and currency aspects, for the year 1999. It calculates the quantity ratio as the total number of sales divided by the total number of returns and the currency ratio as the sum of return amounts divided by the sum of net paid amounts. The query categorizes the results by channel, and the worst ratios are reported for each. The results are sorted in ascending order, first by channel (1), then by the return rank (4), followed by the currency rank (5), and item (2). The query retrieves up to 100 records for the year 1999.
