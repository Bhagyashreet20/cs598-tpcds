With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: This query retrieves the total extended sales prices for each item brand produced by a manufacturer with the ID 816, for all sales that occurred in the 11th month of a specific year. It groups the results by the year of sale, the brand name, and the brand ID, and then sorts them in descending order based on the year and the sum of the sales prices. The query finally limits the result set to the top 100 records.
