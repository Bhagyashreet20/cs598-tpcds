For each county, this query calculates the following aggregates for items purchased through catalog sales by customers born in specific months and living in particular states with certain demographic characteristics: the average quantity of items, the average list price of items, the average coupon amount used, the average sales price, the average net profit, the average age of customers, and the average number of dependents. These results are grouped by the item ID, country, state, and county, and then sorted by country, state, county, and item ID. The query retrieves up to 100 results.
