Compute the revenue ratios across item classes: For each item in the 'Books', 'Sports', and 'Men' categories, during a 30-day time period starting from '1998-04-06', and sold through the web channel, calculate the ratio of sales of each item to the total sales within its respective class. The query retrieves data from the 'web_sales', 'item', and 'date_dim' tables, joins them on relevant keys, and groups the results by 'i_item_id', 'i_item_desc', 'i_category', 'i_class', and 'i_current_price'. The items are further ordered by 'i_category', 'i_class', 'i_item_id', 'i_item_desc', and 'revenueratio', and limited to 100 rows.
