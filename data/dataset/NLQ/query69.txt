Count the number of customers grouped by gender, marital status, education status, purchase estimate, and credit rating. Filter the customers based on the condition that they live in the states of Texas (TX), Virginia (VA), or Michigan (MI). Additionally, consider customers who made purchases from stores but not from catalog or web during the first three months of the year 2000. Sort the results in ascending order based on gender, marital status, education status, purchase estimate, and credit rating, and limit the output to the top 100 results.
