With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: This SQL query calculates the number of items sold in the store named 'ese' during different time intervals of the day, from 8:30 to 9, 9 to 9:30, 9:30 to 10, 10 to 10:30, 10:30 to 11, 11 to 11:30, and 11:30 to 12:30. It considers customers who meet specific conditions: they either have one dependent and 2 or fewer registered vehicles, or 2 dependents with 4 or fewer registered vehicles, or 3 dependents with 5 or fewer registered vehicles. Each of these time intervals is counted separately and presented in a single row as 'h8_30_to_9', 'h9_to_9_30', 'h9_30_to_10', 'h10_to_10_30', 'h10_30_to_11', 'h11_to_11_30', and 'h11_30_to_12'.
