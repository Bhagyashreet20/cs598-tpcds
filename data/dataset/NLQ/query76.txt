This query calculates the count of sales and the sum of sales amounts for different channels, column names, years, quarters, and item categories. It combines data from the 'store,' 'web,' and 'catalog' channels, specifically focusing on the 'ss_hdemo_sk,' 'ws_bill_addr_sk,' and 'cs_warehouse_sk' columns. It filters records where certain foreign keys are NULL and joins the 'store_sales,' 'web_sales,' 'catalog_sales,' 'item,' and 'date_dim' tables. The results are grouped by channel, column name, year, quarter, and item category. The final result set is ordered by channel, column name, year, quarter, item category, and limited to the top 100 rows.
