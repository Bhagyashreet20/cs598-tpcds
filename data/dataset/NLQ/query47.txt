This SQL query retrieves information about item brands and categories for each store and company. It specifically focuses on monthly sales figures for the year 2001, and it identifies instances where the monthly sales significantly deviate from the average monthly sales for that year, with a deviation threshold of more than 10%. The results are then sorted based on the deviation in sales and the store. Furthermore, the query includes a comparison of each row's sales deviation with both the preceding and succeeding months. The query provides a concise summary of sales-related data, and the output is limited to the top 100 records.
