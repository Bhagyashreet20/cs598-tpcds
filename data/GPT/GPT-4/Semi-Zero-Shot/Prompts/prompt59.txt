With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: This SQL query retrieves information about the increase in weekly store sales from one year to the next year for each store and day of the week. It calculates the difference in sales for each store on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The comparison is made between the year 1196 and the following year (i.e., from 1196 to 1197). The data is organized by store name, store ID, and week number. The query restricts the results to the top 100 records.
