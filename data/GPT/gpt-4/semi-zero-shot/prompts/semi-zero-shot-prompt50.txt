With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: For each store, we are counting the number of items sold in a specific month during the year 2001 and August (d_year = 2001, d_moy = 8) that were returned after different time intervals from the day of purchase. These time intervals are categorized as follows: "30 days," "31-60 days," "61-90 days," "91-120 days," and ">120 days." This information is retrieved from the store_sales and store_returns tables, joined with the store and date_dim tables using various conditions, including matching date_sk values. After counting, the results are grouped by store attributes, such as store name, company ID, address details, and zip code. Finally, the results are ordered by the same store attributes and limited to the top 100 records.
