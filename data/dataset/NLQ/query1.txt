Retrieve the customer IDs of customers who have returned items significantly more frequently (over 20% above the average return rate) than the average customer return rate for a store in the state of South Dakota in the year 2000. This query calculates the total returns for each customer at each store and compares it to the store's average returns for the specified year. It then retrieves the customer IDs of those whose returns exceed the calculated threshold. The results are sorted by customer ID, and a limit of 100 records is applied
