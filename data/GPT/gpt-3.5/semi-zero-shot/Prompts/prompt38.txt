With the TPC-DS dataset as a reference, using the table and field names from the TPC-DS benchmark, convert natural language directive provided as input into an SQL query in the Netezza dialect?
Input: Count the number of customers who made purchases from all three sales channels in a specified year. The query retrieves distinct customer last names, first names, and transaction dates from the "store_sales," "catalog_sales," and "web_sales" tables, along with corresponding date information from the "date_dim" table, and customer information from the "customer" table. It filters the results based on a specific month sequence within the given year, and the final result is limited to the top 100 rows.
